Regularly Monitored | Governments should build sustainable infrastructure that is capable of continuously assessing  AI systems as they are rapidly changing | Agencies should continuously update their guidelines as AI models change and develop. Companies must continuously test their AI application to ensure they are in line with governmental guidelines and policies
